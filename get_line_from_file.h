 * char *get_line_from_file(int fd, int *error_num):
 *
 * Function get_line_from_file() is an alternate implementation of C standard
 * library's getline() function and this function is much simpler to use than
 * getline().
 *
 * Function get_line_from_file() returns a line from the file represented by fd.
 *
 * This function supports only regular files (no pipes, sockets, etc).
 *
 * If fd is less than 0 then NULL is returned and *error_num is assigned the
 * appropriate error value (INVALID_FD in this case).
 *
 * In case of any error, *error_num is assigned the appropriate error value.
 *
 * The high level algorithm of this function is:
 *
 *      The function get_line_from_file() reads some bytes in a buffer from the
 *      file and tries to find the newline in the buffer. If the newline is not
 *      found then it reads more bytes from the file in the buffer. When the
 *      newline is found in the buffer, then the newline is replaced with the
 *      null terminating character and the buffer is reallocated to the correct
 *      size. Then the file offset for reading is set to the start of the next
 *      line. And then the buffer is returned to the user.
 *
 * Please note that the returned line/buffer doesn't contain any newlines.
 *
 * The line/buffer returned by this function is allocated using realloc(),
 * so it is user's responsibility to free the line (free memory).
